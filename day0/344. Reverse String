// s + sSize - 1 會指向最後一個字元，因為 char* 遞增是以 1 byte 為單位, this is a pointer thing, would be +1 for a int pointer as well, not +4

// strlen(s) counts the elements before '\0', can pass a pointer to char(or string), will return the lenght of char(or string) 
// sizeof(s) counts all the elements (encluding '\0'), cannot pass pointer to this function, will rerturn the length of pointer,
